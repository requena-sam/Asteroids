# Asteroids

An incomplete implementation of the classic Asteroids game based
on https://www.echalk.co.uk/amusements/Games/asteroidsClassic/ateroids.html

This implementation is a work in progress and is built to teach basic canvas concepts.

Definitely not a production ready game.

No pull request needed nor accepted.

Have a great life !
